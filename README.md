## Authentication

User authentication is handled in the `lib/auth.ts` file. The authentication flow supports user registration, login, and session management.
>Explain how the authentication logic is implemented, including any specific libraries or services used.

## Components

Key components used in the application include:

*   **CustomButton:** A reusable button component with customizable styling.
*   **InputField:** A styled input field component with built-in validation.
*   **OAuth:** A component for handling authentication via third-party providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).

## Configuration


>API_URL=https://api.example.com
>AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
>The `npm run reset-project` command is used to reset the project to a clean state. This command moves the current contents of the `app` directory to `app-example` and creates a new, empty `app` directory. This is useful when you want to start with a fresh project structure or discard your current changes.
